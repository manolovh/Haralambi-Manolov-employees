# EmployeePairs

Compiled with OpenJdk - Version 11.0.22

The program reads data from CSV file and shows all the projects that the employees in the top pair have worked together. Currently only date formats of types - "dd-MMM-yyyy", "dd.MM.yyyy", "yyyy-MM-dd",
			"dd-MMMM-yyyy", "dd/MM/yyyy" - are supported. The list can be later extended.

   Unit tests were designed to be runnable via the Eclipse IDE.
